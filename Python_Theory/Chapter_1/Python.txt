Python Lines and Indentation

    Python programming provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.

    The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For  example âˆ’

    if True:
        print ("True")
    else:
        print ("False")
